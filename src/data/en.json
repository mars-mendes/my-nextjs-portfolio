        "Hi there! My name’s Mars (they/he), I’m a 24 yo Digital Experiences Developer at IBM and a UX/UI student (EBAC).",
        "I've been working as a developer for the last 4 years, starting my career as an intern and mostly focusing on creating and maintaining marketing web pages. Along the way, I had the opportunity to become a full-time developer. Right now, my responsibilities go beyond coding as I actively participate in different communication and education projects and also have been working with experienced designers on UX research.",
        "My technical background includes expertise in JavaScript, React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Angular and recently I've been expanding my knowledge participating in research projects that explore XR technologies like A-frame, Adobe Aero, and Unity. I also hold certifications in Design Thinking and Agile methodologies.",
        "Within my team, I work on the influencers initiative, where we come up with campaigns, activities, and media to engage people internally. I'm also part of an initiative that connects leadership with their teams, where we discuss education, feedback, and other aspects related to Agile practices.",
        "Recently, I accomplished a few great things, such as working on improving an asset at IBM to make it ready for translation and contributing to the IBM Think event page. And I'm involved in two UX research projects where we're defining the user journey: I create scripts for interviews with users and stakeholders and facilitate Design Thinking sessions.",
